    <h1>The Top Five State Websites</h1>
    <i>Out of the Five I Actually Looked At</i>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">Nebraska</a></h3>
            <p>Overall a clean visually appealing website that seems to have a good idea of what it's visitors are
                actually looking for. The hover menu makes efficient use of space although doesn't work reliably on my
                device. Also, the public calendar appears to be broken on my device.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="https://delaware.gov/">Delaware</a></h3>
            <p>Probably the website with the best color palette and fonts. It's focus on Coronavirus may detract from
                the experience of users looking for other information about the state. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">Florida</a></h3>
            <p>Relatively minimal design, basically just a search bar. A bit sparse, but it works I suppose. Great cover
                photo, section looks good, footer is a little ugly. Certain elements like the "How can we help you?" in
                the search bar could use a bit more color contrast.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="https://www.illinois.gov">Illinois</a></h3>
            <p>Overall, it's not a bad website. It's relatively clean on top, if a little cluttered when you scroll
                down. Good font and relatively consistent color scheme. It's major failure is that the "Illinois Virtual
                Assistant" is not working.
                The Alerts are kinda clunky and I think it'd look better if the "State of the State" banner wasn't above
                the navbar.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></h3>
            <p>This site has two navbars, which is confusing. The hover 'Resident, Business, Visitor' menu is
                unintuitive and kind of ugly. The page is filled with links and most of the text is too small. Unrelated
                things collide, like translations and flag status. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
