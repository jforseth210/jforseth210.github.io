        <h1>Site Review</h1>
        <p>For my sites, I chose <a href="https://www.mybib.com">MyBib</a>, <a
                href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, and <a href="https://theaet.com">the AET</a>. These are
            all sites that I use (or at least used) fairly regularly, so I have a decent idea of what I do and don't
            like about each.</p>
        <p>Let's talk about MyBib first. This is a citation generation tool I found after the ads on Citation Machine
            made it almost unusable. Unlike citation machine, this site very useful and not riddled with ads. The layout
            is two column, with a main section that shows your Works Cited, with a sidebar for selecting various
            projects. Navigation is highly intuitive with common options like adding citations, selecting a citation
            format, collaborating with others, and exporting your citations being made available via a horizontal menu
            at the top. All options related to individual citations (including editing, copying a full citation or
            parenthetical citation, etc) can be done by clicking on an individual citation from within the bibliography.
            Modals have a nice flying-in animation. The color scheme is consistent and visually appealing. The code is a
            little complex, but pretty readable.</p>
        <p>I don't have as much to say about DuckDuckGo. It has a nice, fairly minimal design. It shows you a search
            box. You type in a query and it shows you results. It does one thing and does it well. It had a variety of
            color schemes, the dark mode looks great. It has some great little features built in (a QR code generator, a
            translator, etc), as well as wikipedia information on a sidebar. The code is pretty readable. It doesn't
            really go over the top with colors and animations or anything. It just works.</p>
        <p>The AET does not "just work". Navigation is a horrible mess of menus and sub-menus. Some of the pages I
            wanted to look at for this essay have entirely disappeared or are buried behind a menu that, despite four
            years of using this software I am unable to find. Some buttons don't look like they have any styling
            whatsoever, some elements don't have any padding. Some buttons are just icons with no tooltips, labels, or
            indication as to what they actually do. Popups look like they're straight out of Windows Vista. It uses
            tables for formatting and incomprehensible acronyms for class names. The top header, while being a complete
            waste of screen real-estate, does have a nice blue background color. Icons look good, I suppose, mostly
            consistent throughout. It doesn't really have any animations or anything. I would rather write recordkeeping
            software myself (<a href="https://gitlab.com/jforseth210/CattleDatabase">no, seriously</a>) than use the
            AET.</p>
        <p>MyBib and DuckDuckGo both do one thing and do it well. When I'm using them, I don't have to think about it.
            They get out of the way and let me worry about the problem at hand: My paper or my question or whatever it
            is I'm working on. The AET does a lot of things, poorly. When I use it, it is the problem at hand. The
            records themselves are secondary to the problem of trying to figure out how to get it into the AET. All of
            these sites are designed to serve a purpose. They aren't here to entertain or provide information, they
            solve a problem. When done well, they get out of your way, you don't have to think about them. When done
            poorly, they become problems themselves. </p>

            There is an very small, but not zero chance that I meet the AET people, or even work on the AET.              
            I doubt that'll happen, but it's a small world, and it'd be pretty embarassing if my criticism of   
            the AET were to show up after Googling me.        
            
            Since there is nothing more permanent than temporary code, I'm going to try to give this a bit of an 
            expiration date (Jan 1, 2023). Obviously it'll still be in the source, but it'll be at least a little
            hidden in the browser.
