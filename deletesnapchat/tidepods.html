            <h1>Petition to Use Something Other than Snapchat</h1>
            <h5>Did you know that when you use Snapchat, you waive your moral rights? That's not hyperbole, that's a
                quote from the Terms of Service:</h5>
            <blockquote>"To the extent permissible under law, you irrevocably waive—or agree not to assert against Snap
                and its affiliates to the extent a waiver is not permitted—any moral rights or equivalent rights you may
                have in the Asset throughout the world."</blockquote>
            <h5>Curious what else is in there?</h5>
            <h5>Those disappearing messages? They don't necessarily delete those:</h5>
            <blockquote>"After a Snap is deleted, we’ll mainly be able to see the basic details — like when it was sent
                and who it was sent to."</blockquote>
            <h5>But, they don't show them to anyone, right?</h5>
            <blockquote>" We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is
                needed to: <ul>
                    <li>comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or
                        regulation."</blockquote>
            <h5>But that's only for legal reasons. They wouldn't show my Snaps to just anyone, would they?</h5>
            <blockquote>"to archive, copy, cache, encode, store, reproduce, record, sell, sublicense, distribute,
                transmit, broadcast, synchronize, adapt, edit, modify, <b>publicly display, publicly perform, publish,
                    republish, promote, exhibit,</b> create derivative works based upon, and otherwise use the Asset on
                or in
                connection with the Services and the advertising, marketing, and promotion thereof, in all formats, on
                or through any means or media now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now
                known or hereafter developed. "</blockquote>
            <small>(Emphasis added)</small>
            <h5>Well, if they do something bad, I can sue them right?</h5>
            <blockquote>"EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THE ARBITRATION PROVISION OF THE SNAP INC.
                TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND SNAP AGREE THAT CLAIMS AND DISPUTES, INCLUDING STATUTORY CLAIMS AND DISPUTES,
                ARISING BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE ARBITRATION
                PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THE ARBITRATION PROVISION OF THE SNAP INC. TERMS OF SERVICE, "</blockquote>
            <small>I'm not a lawyer (this is not legal advice), but that sounds like a no...</small>
            <h5>Why do we keep using it?</h5>
            <p>Because everyone else does.</p>
            <h5>I'm not willing to delete Snapchat...</h5>
            <p>I'm not asking you to. Just, give another messaging app a chance. I recommend Signal. Use it, or
                something else (Delta Chat, Matrix, Threema, even SMS or iMessage) where you can, keep using Snapchat
                where you can't use anything else. And, eventually, if you no longer have a use for it, delete Snapchat.</p>
