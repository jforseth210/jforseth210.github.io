                <h1>Winter</h1>
                <p>Winter is mostly known for being cold. Most people don't like being cold, so it's not a very popular
                    season.</p>
                <p>That being said, there are some activities that require cold, like skiing, snowboarding, ice skating,
                    snowmobiling, ice fishing, sledding, snowman making, snow fort making, and swimming, but <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_swimming">for crazy
                        people.</a> People who enjoy these activities tend to enjoy winter as well.</p>
                <p>One of the most popular holidays in Winter is Christmas. We celebrate God becoming man by buying a
                    bunch of stuff, flavoring everything like peppermint, and listening to frustratingly catchy music.</p>
