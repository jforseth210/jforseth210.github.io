                <h1>Spring</h1>
                <p>Spring is a season know for it's <s>warm weather</s> snow storms. Some believe that the season is the
                    result of nature being unable to decide between winter and summer and rapidly switching between the
                    two instead.</p>
                <p>It's known for new beginnings, new growth, new births. It's also known for being <em>not quite</em>
                    warm enough to partake comfortably in many summertime activities, most notably water fights,
                    swimming, and camping outside.</p>
                <p>One of the most popular holidays in Spring is Easter. We celebrate Jesus' coming back
                    to life after being dead for three days by hiding colored eggs and eating bean-shaped candy. Also
                    there's something about a bunny.</p>
