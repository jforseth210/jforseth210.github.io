            <p>Tide PODS® offer a 3-in-1 laundry solution to all your dirty problems. More than just a detergent, Tide
                PODS®
                also contain a stain remover and a brightener in one convenient pac. These detergent pacs are filled
                with a
                super-concentrated detergent, and their small, compact doses mean minimal hassle for you. Not to mention
                they're also HE compatible! Now, thanks to Tide POWER PODS®, Tide’s latest, greatest innovation, not
                even
                oversized laundry loads and set-in stains can stand in the way of giving your clothes a refreshing,
                brilliant Tide clean.</p>
            <p>One of the main benefits of detergent pacs is their ease of use. Simply follow the instructions below to
                get
                an outstanding Tide clean. Because Tide PODS® also act as an HE detergent, they work just as well when
                used
                in high-efficiency machines.</p>
